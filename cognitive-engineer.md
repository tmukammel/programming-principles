# The Cognitive Software Engineer

I am going to try and depict an ideal engineer - what are the standards an ideal engineer should strive to achieve.

## Spirit to Think and Meta-think

An engineer should be like ***[Samwise the Brave](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiglrq8keHuAhUZXisKHfTfCGkQFjAJegQIBRAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSamwise_Gamgee&usg=AOvVaw2uRoqTqvVrth28uo7zRvwZ)*** from *[Lord of the Rings](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiv1czekeHuAhVab30KHVFhAicQFjAAegQIDBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)&usg=AOvVaw1TR-Hgq25tLWKoeTo9uTOz)* - **nothing ever dampens his spirit!** He knows he must help [Frodo Baggins](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjxz6DpkuHuAhVDXn0KHZpBCQQQFjAKegQICxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFrodo_Baggins&usg=AOvVaw3UKzO681mv3lqPpg2F_xd5) find the mount doom and destroy the ring, but it is such a heavy task just to try and think to do it let alone do it! But in this heart and mind the vision of the outcome drags him on this dangerous path to mount doom.

Samwise the Brave teaches an engineer the courage and endurance in finding the best solution.

By his spirit he makes himself **actively and consciously think and takes steps** to get there - holds himself **accountable** to the outcome vs those standards. By *actively* we mean that he takes steps and measures whether his steps are constructive or destructive, and by *consciously* we mean realising whether he understands the context or circumstances he is working under.

He pays extreme importance to his daily activity and process of working and learning. He **meta-thinks** - he is aware, can calculate, and take strategic steps to improve how he thinks, learns, measures and works.

You want to get there, but it's not easy - any sane person would give up - if you haven’t yet you are insane! The same was told by Steve Jobs.

## Communication and Empathy

An engineer always does something for someone else, more importantly to make someone else’s life easier. Understanding and believing in this simple concept has critical importance for the engineer, his co-workers and not least for the users.

### Don’t just look, see what you read

He actively sees the implications (that are not explicitly stated) and try and foresee the consequences of what’s written. Draw into the mind what he is reading and what he is not (what's missing or left unsaid). This helps one to understand and follow instructions (e.g software specifications) and proactively ask for clarifications.

### Write what you write like how they need

For a subject he is writing, he is aware of some key aspects about what he is writing and for whom he is writing

- The target audience
- Background knowledge about the subject matter of the audience
- Reason why they want to read what you write
- The readers context
- How much time the audience would get to read
- Are the assumptions that are being made stated explicitly

For example when one write in bullet points he inherently suppose that the reader knows the context and have the relevant knowledge; but he should ask himself a second time who are the readers and what is their field of work, imagine their perspective and relevant knowledge of the subject matter - you can write these down to help you remember how they need you to write what you write. Considering these factors will help you to decide between bullet points, sentence fragments or organised sentence paragraphs.

Imagine a team of engineers have built a new digital marketing software. They have written a document for the marketing team which emphasises on the software's USP. Suppose the software is so advanced that it can tell a seller exactly how many customers are there who need to buy what the seller sells just this moment or any moment. But the written document says something like this - `Analyses and finds target subject in real time`.
